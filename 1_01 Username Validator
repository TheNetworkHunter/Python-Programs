#Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a username.
#The program should then check if the username meets the following criteria:
#The username must be at least 6 characters long and not exceed 15 characters.
# The username must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z) and can be followed by letters,
# digits (0-9), or underscores (_).
#If the username meets all the criteria, the program should print "Username is valid."
#Otherwise, it should display an appropriate error message indicating why the username
# is not valid.

username = input(str("Enter your Username "))

max_length = 15
def login():
    if username[0].isalpha() and len(username) >= 6 and len(username) <= 15:
        print("Your username is valid.")
    else:
        print("Your username is NOT valid.")
